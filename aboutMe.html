                            <p>Hi there!</p>
                            <p>
                                I'm Elwin Ung and I'm from Toronto, Canada. I graduated from Ryerson University in summer 2019 with the Bacholor of Electrical Engineering.
                                Electrical engineering was cool to me when I was younger and becoming an engineer was my career goal until I was lost after graduating and COVID-19 hit the world.<br>
                                After months of job applying/self-exploring/online learning, I found full-stack development, especially back-end development because I enjoy programming and providing solutions more than designing (but I do think I have pretty good sense).<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm currently taking a full-stack bootcamp hosted by University of Toronto and Trilogy. 
                                Here is the <a href="https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/coding/" target="blank"><strong>link</strong></a> to the bootcamp's site if you want to see what I have been learning or check out my <a href="portfolio.html"><strong>portfolio</strong></a> to see what I can actually do.

                        As a programmer, I do love gaming, especially FPS since the first game I played was Counter-Strike and I spent quite a bit of my childhood playing it.
                        I also like immerse myself into fiction novels as they depict worlds and stories that carry me away from reality. 
                        Life science books are my "backups", especially psychology if I don't have a good novel at the time.
                        They expand my understanding on how we as human beings work and maybe one day I can overcome natural responses to the environment around me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another hobby I do is Kendo. It is a martial art and a sport nowadays. It helps me release stress from studying and discipline myself into building routines because of its martial art nature.
                        I didn't expect much when I first started but the growing commnuity has kept me going and I enjoy building the connections.
                        Here is a <a href="https://kendo-canada.com/about-kendo/" target="blank"><strong>quick introduction</strong></a> on Kendo in case you are interested.
